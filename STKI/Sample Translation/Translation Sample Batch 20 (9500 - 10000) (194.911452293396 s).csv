silicamagnetite coating technique asmc and without magnetite asc has been done through the solgel process the both adsorbents were characterized by an infrared spectrophotometer ir xray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem the primary objective of this study was to study the adsorption capacity of the material synthesized algae biomass chaetoceros sp by coating silicamagnetite the cu ii ion in the singular and the competition with metal ions such as ni ii zn ii cd ii and pb ii ion as a pair ion binary system in the solution the adsorption process of cu ii ion was performed in a single and binary systems using batch method interaction of cu ii ion with the asc and asmc was studied in the ph range of 2-8 effect of ph interaction of cu ii ion in solution with asc and asmc figure 1 showed that the adsorption of cu ii ion was optimum at ph 6 with the percentage of cu ii ion adsorbed on the asc and asmc respectively by 80 and 97% 1-2 effect of interaction time of cu ii ion on the asc and the asmc takes place relatively quickly in the first 15 minutes the adsorption increased very sharply after 15 minutes of the second there was a slight increase in cu ii ion adsorbed and achieve constant at 60 minutes at this stage the adsorption process is estimated to have reached equilibrium and extra time did not give rise to the amount of metal ions adsorbed significantly 3 the adsorption data of cu ii ion on the asc and asmc within a single system follows the pseudo kinetic model of order 2 with the adsorption rate of cu ii ion on the asmc faster than the asc the adsorption isotherm model of cu ii ion on the asc and asmc tend to follow langmuir adsorption isotherm model with adsorption capacity of respectively 57.77 and 105.91 mg g-1 from the data competition of cu ii ion with ion pair of ni ii zn ii cd ii and pb ii in solution figure 2 can be observed that in general the asmc adsorbent can adsorb all metal ions with a fairly high percentage although between the metal ion pairs competed have different sizes ionic radii differences radius of metal ions which competed in the adsorption process is one of the determining factors of the selectivity of an adsorbent to metal ions 4 this indicates that the asmc is not selective for the metal ions competed thus it can be stated that the asmc adsorbent can be used in the treatment of waste containing a mixture of multicomponent metal because it is not selective for the particular metal
