significant influence on the information quality of village management accounting the information quality of village management accounting has positive and significant influence on village finance management the more quality of the information generated by siskeudes information that is relevant accurate complete timeliness predictable aggregate and integrated the better village finance management transparent accountable participative the implementation of act number 6 2014 about the village has positive and significant influence on village finance management the implementation of act number 6 2014 is reflected by being implemented the strategy organization movement leadership and good control so that it will create the transparent accountable and participative village finance management the implication of this result is that villages must implement a high quality management accounting information system to produce quality information to improve village finance management sufficient socialization and assistance are required for the apparatuses in using that information system besides the government must also have a good supervisory and performance measurement system to achieve accountable transparent and participative village finance management the large allocation of funds from the central government to the village in indonesia 1 billion rupiah for 1 village and a
