performance of agricultural growth is the second lowest after the mining sector s growth of 1.5 per cent agricultural performance is obviously lower than that of the manufacturing and service sectors achieving 5.7 percent and 8.1 percent growth respectively the estate crops fisheries and food crops sectors have contributed to agricultural growth performance mostly because the world price of such important commodities remains high contributing significantly to the added value of agricul tural sectors however in view of the quality of growth argument a 4.0 percent growth is simply not adequate to generate more em ployment and alleviate poverty the current administration of president susilo bambang yudhoyono sby has issued several policies affecting the growth and performance of the agricultural sector under a package of revitalizing agriculture it has implemented a quadruple tracks strategy progrowth projob propoor and proenvironment that is an improvement from the tripletrack strategy of the previous administra tion adding the last expression of proenvironment subsidies on agricultural inputs particularly fertilizer seed and some subsidized credit programs are among the important policies to improve food and crop production and achieve food selfsufficiency in five strate gic commodities rice corn soybean sugar and beef although there has been no significant

moderate 4.0 percent per year in 2012 a significant increase from a 2.9 percent growth right after the global financial crisis in 2010 the performance of agricultural growth is the second lowest after the mining sector s growth of 1.5 per cent agricultural performance is obviously lower than that of the manufacturing and service sectors achieving 5.7 percent and 8.1 percent growth respectively the estate crops fisheries and food crops sectors have contributed to agricultural growth performance mostly because the world price of such important commodities remains high contributing significantly to the added value of agricul tural sectors however in view of the quality of growth argument a 4.0 percent growth is simply not adequate to generate more em ployment and alleviate poverty the current administration of president susilo bambang yudhoyono sby has issued several policies affecting the growth and performance of the agricultural sector under a package of revitalizing agriculture it has implemented a quadruple tracks strategy progrowth projob propoor and proenvironment that is an improvement from the tripletrack strategy of the previous administra tion adding the last expression of
