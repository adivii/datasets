coverage and the size of the subsidy and introduced direct cash subsidies for the poor this mix of policies and financial incentives provided householdlevel benefits but overall indonesia s relatively strong food security in 2008 was built on the level of price control made possible through solid domestic production the global food crisis of 2008 has been interpreted by many as an early warning sign of global economic conditions in the years ahead as indonesia and other countries are expected to grapple with the vagaries of climate change and its impacts on food production in this context having national control over the life source of the nation holds both emotive and practical appeal the collective national memory of indonesia s inability to buy food on the world market in the 1960s and hence the perceived need to be selfsufficient is juxtaposed over the experiences of localized food shortages and famine such as those in yahukimo caused by entrapment in a subsistence economy and isolation from broader trade and social networks these two typified experiences and the complexities of addressing food insecurity as multiscalar phenomena are driving what may seem to be contradictory policies at national and regional levels singularly prescrip tive policy approaches such as selfsufficiency at all costs or full liberalization of agricultural markets are unlikely to solve the food security conundrum in indonesia food security is most likely to be achieved through broadbased rural development where individual households are supported to improve their access to resources and factors of production through an entitlements approach
